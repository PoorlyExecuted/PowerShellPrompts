# PowerShell Prompt Functions

This repository contains my collection of custom prompt functions.

## Prompt Overview

### Effervescent

**Effervescent** is a Prompt function designed to be simple, elegant, yet informative in a low-key manner. The information displayed overtly includes the current user's UserName, the UserDomain, current Wifi connection status, the time, and full filesystem path.

More subtly, *Effervescent* also clues the user in to whether the current session is elevated via colorizing the user icon and UserName, and the path prefix icon and color of the path string itself also change based on whether the user is in the main (C:) drive, or an external drive.
